This is a year 3/4 undergraduate course for geoscientists taught by [Matthew Piggott](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.d.piggott) and Rhodri Nelson.
It is designed to be a first introduction to inversion methods.

Each lecture will cover:

* some introductory mathematics/theory underlying the numerical techniques used to perform inversion
* implementation exercises to help understand the theory
* programming exercises where we will implement algorithms from scratch ourselves
* exposure to a sophisticated library to perform geophysical inversion

### Pre-requisite knowledge

Your  *Seismology and* [*Numerical Methods*](http://matt-piggott.github.io/Numerical-methods-undergraduate/), *Mathematics for Scientists and Engineers* and *Introduction to Programming for Geoscientists module* modules are prerequisite for this course.
Please refer back to this to remind yourself of introductory information on Python.

You can also find some useful introductory Python material here
[ESE Primer](https://primer-computational-mathematics.github.io/book/b_coding/Intro%20to%20Python/intro.html).


### Jupyter notebook

The lectures notes are written in [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). This is a web-based interactive computational environment where you can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots etc into a single document.

For some information on Jupyter notebooks for this module specifically see: [Jupyter notebooks](http://matt-piggott.github.io/Geophysical-inversion-undergraduate/notebooks/).
