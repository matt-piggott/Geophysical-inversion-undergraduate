    "\n",
    "By damping the least squares system, we have protected the solution against zero or small eigenvalues by adding a constant value, controlled by $\\mu$, to the diagonal of $A^TA$. If $\\mu$ is very small,  then  we  will  have something very close to  regular  least  squares (cf. the under-determined case above);  if  $\\mu$  is  very  large, then  we  will  simply minimise the norm of the model parameters (the second term dominating the first).  Choosing the value of $\\mu$ therefore involves a  trade-off between fitting the data and stabilising the result.  \n",

    "We saw earlier that the minimal-norm inverse involved first finding an exact or best least-squares fit to the data, then, subject to that constraint, finding the solution that minimised the $L^2$-norm of the model/solution vector (cf. an earlier homework exercise - \"minimal-norm solution to under-determined problem\").\n",
    " \n",
    "Damped  least-squares  does  something  similar,  except  here  the parameter $\\mu$ is adjusted to control the degree to which the solution fits the data (which is favoured by decreasing the value of $\\mu$), and the degree to which it  minimises  the  norm  of  the  model (which is favoured by increasing the value of $\\mu$). Recall that in practice a problem may well be formulated such that it is the perturbation to an *a priori* model rather than the model itself that is minimised. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea here is to set the value of $\\mu$ so that it removes the influence of small eigenvalues in $A^TA$ from the problem, but leaves the larger eigenvalues alone.  The larger eigenvalues then control the fit to the data (the smaller eigenvalues would contribute almost nothing to this  fit  anyway  because  they  are  small),  and  the  resulting  under-determined model is then fully determined by minimising its norm.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Including only  the  largest  eigenvalues  in  the  solution  will effectively  reduce  the  resolution  of  the recovered  model  parameters,  whereas  including  the  smaller  eigenvalues  will  increase  the noise  within  the  recovered  model  parameters.    We  are  therefore  trading  resolution  against noise in the model, and the value of $\\mu$ controls that trade-off.  Yet another way to regard $\\mu$ is that we should choose it so that the fit to the data is only as good as is required by the level of noise in the data, but no better.  If we insist on lowering $\\mu$ beyond this, then we will be [***over-fitting***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting) the data - the increased apparent match to the observed data will then merely serve to map noise from the data into the model without additional benefit to the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, it can be difficult to choose $\\mu$ to achieve these outcomes.  One way to do this, at least in principle, is to invert the data using a range of values for $\\mu$, and then plot the model norm against the data-residual norm as in \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are lucky, there may be a corner or elbow in this plot that indicates a clear break and an optimal value for $\\mu$; in many problems though no obvious  corner  appears.   If  we  know  the  data  errors,  then  we  can  compute  the  minimum useful value of the data-residual norm, and select a value of $\\mu$ that is consistent with this."

    "Use of damped least-squares assumes implicitly that we know something about the model parameters that is independent  of  the data - that is we know it *a  priori*, before we undertake the experiment or observations that generate the data.  \n",
    "In this case, our *a priori* knowledge is simply that the model should have a smal  norm, ideally zero.    \n",
    "This assumption is most appropriate when, in the absence of data, we would assume that the model was zero - typically this will be the case when the model for which we are inverting is the perturbation to some best-guess starting model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, assuming a minimum-norm is not the only a priori assumption we can make. \n",
    "We might instead assume for example that the norm of the first or second  derivatives of the model parameters should be small.   \n",
    "The first of these is the assumption that the model is  \"flat\" - all the model parameters are the same - and the second is the assumption that the model is \"smooth\" - the variation between adjacent parameters is everywhere the same.   \n",

    "There are many other forms of regularisation possible, but these three illustrate the general idea. \n",
    "\n",
