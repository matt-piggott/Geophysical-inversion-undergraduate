    "The quality of the prediction can then be compared at the green squares where data was not used in the inversion. We find that the error in  prediction at these independent locations is indeed reduced within the same numerical model. We have also found that the prediction is improved when these physical values are used in a completely independent tidal model. This latter fact gives us some indication that our inversion is telling us something useful physically and not simply correcting for biases in the first model."

    "1. Does the solution exist? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Is the solution unique? \n",

    "\n",
    "3. Is the solution stable? \n",
    "\n",

    "From a physical point of view, we will often know that there must be a solution since we are likely to be studying real physical systems.  But from the mathematical/computational point of view, given the errors in the observations as well as in $G$, there may be no model parameters at all that exactly fits the observed data. \n",

In this case, it will be impossible to distinguish these two model parameter sets from the given data, though we may have good a priori reasons to prefer one over the other.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The  final  question  of  stability  is  critical  in  inversion  theory.    Suppose  that  two  different model parameter sets $\\boldsymbol{m}_1$  and $\\boldsymbol{m}_2$   generate two different datasets  $\\boldsymbol{d}_1$  and $\\boldsymbol{d}_2$.  Also assume that these two sets of parameters  are  very  different,  while  the  difference  between  the  two  datasets  is  small  and  lies within the noise level $\\boldsymbol{e}$.  In this case, if we attempt to fit the observed data exactly, then the resulting parameter sets may vary dramatically but solely as a result of changes in the noise. \n",
