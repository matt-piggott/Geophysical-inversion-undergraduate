    "\n",
    "In this example from some current research we have a model for tides in the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary, there are multiple numerical and physical \"parameters\" that go into the model, including incoming tidal boundary conditions, bathymetry etc, some of which are known to varying levels of uncertainty. \n",

    "The quality of the prediction can then be compared at the green squares where data was not used in the inversion. We find that the error in  prediction at these independent locations is indeed reduced within the same numerical model. We have also found that the prediction is improved when these physical values are used in a completely independent tidal model. This latter fact gives us some indication that our inversion is telling us something useful physically and not simply correcting for biases in the first model.\n",

So $G$ can be thought of as a numerical model describing the underlying \"physics\", as well as things like the geometry and boundary conditions etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generation of the forward model often involves the discretisation of (partial differential equations) and actually solving the **forward model**: given $\\boldsymbol{m}$ compute $\\boldsymbol{d}$, may require linear or nonlinear solves so may be very costly, but in general is straightforward once a stable and robust $G$ has been constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The **inverse problem** asks the inverse model, for a given (e.g. set of observational data $\\boldsymbol{d}$) what can we conclude about the model parameters $\\boldsymbol{m}$, i.e. conceptually can we do thie following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boldsymbol{m} = G^{-1}(\\boldsymbol{d}) $$\n",

    "\n",
    "Additionally, it will often be the case that the inverse equation has no exact  solution  at  all  (**non-existence**),  or  that  there  will be infinitely many solutions that all fit the data equally accurately (**non-uniqueness**), or that the solution for the model parameter $\\boldsymbol{m}$ varies  significantly when only very small changes are made to  the input data $\\boldsymbol{d}$ (**instability**). \n",

    "In the solution of any inverse problem, three important questions arise: \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Does the solution exist? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Is the solution unique? \n",

    "3. Is the solution stable? \n",

    "From a physical point of view, we will often know that there must be a solution since we are likely to be studying real physical systems.  But from the mathematical/computational point of view, given the errors in the observations as well as in $G$, there may be no model parameters at all that exactly fits the observed data. \n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a model parameter set that fits the data, say $G(\\boldsymbol{m}_1) = \\boldsymbol{d}$, then that solution will not be unique if there is also another model parameter set $\\boldsymbol{m}_2$  such that $G(\\boldsymbol{m}_2) = \\boldsymbol{d}$.  In this case, it will be impossible to distinguish these two model parameter sets from the given data, though we may have good a priori reasons to prefer one over the other.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The  final  question  of  stability  is  critical  in  inversion  theory.    Suppose  that  two  different model parameter sets $\\boldsymbol{m}_1$  and $\\boldsymbol{m}_2$   generate two different datasets  $\\boldsymbol{d}_1$  and $\\boldsymbol{d}_2$.  Also assume that these two sets of parameters  are  very  different,  while  the  difference  between  the  two  datasets  is  small  and  lies within the noise level $\\boldsymbol{e}$.  In this case, if we attempt to fit the observed data exactly, then the resulting parameter sets may vary dramatically but solely as a result of changes in the noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "In  the  early  part  of  the  twentieth  century,  it  was  widely  considered  that  a  mathematical problem  was  formulated  correctly  if  all  the  three  questions  posed  above  had  a  positive answer.  A mathematical problem was  considered well-posed if its solution did exist, was unique,  and  was  stable.    In  contrast,  a  problem  was  ill-posed,  and  was  not  considered physically or mathematically meaningful, if its solution did not exist, or was not unique, or was not a continuous function of the data (i.e. if for a small perturbation of the data there corresponded an arbitrarily large perturbation of the solution).   \n",
