    "The quality of the prediction can then be compared at the green squares where data was not used in the inversion. We find that the error in  prediction at these independent locations is indeed reduced within the same numerical model. We have also found that the prediction is improved when these physical values are used in a completely independent tidal model. This latter fact gives us some indication that our inversion is telling us something useful physically and not simply correcting for biases in the first model."

In this case, it will be impossible to distinguish these two model parameter sets from the given data, though we may have good a priori reasons to prefer one over the other.  \n",

Suppose  that  two  different model parameter sets $\\boldsymbol{m}_1$  and $\\boldsymbol{m}_2$   generate two different datasets  $\\boldsymbol{d}_1$  and $\\boldsymbol{d}_2$.  Also assume that these two sets of parameters  are  very  different,  while  the  difference  between  the  two  datasets  is  small  and  lies within the noise level $\\boldsymbol{e}$.

A mathematical problem was  considered well-posed if its solution did exist, was unique,  and  was  stable.    In  contrast,  a  problem  was  ill-posed,  and  was  not  considered physically or mathematically meaningful, if its solution did not exist, or was not unique, or was not a continuous function of the data (i.e. if for a small perturbation of the data there corresponded an arbitrarily large perturbation of the solution).   \n",
